## Features
- **Real-Time Stress Monitoring**: Continuously assess stress levels using physiological signals.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for easy interaction and data visualization.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes state-of-the-art algorithms for accurate stress detection.
- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis tools to interpret stress-related data effectively.

## Technology Stack
This project is built using:
- **Python**: The primary programming language for implementing the framework.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks related to facial expression analysis.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: To build and train machine learning models for stress detection.
- **Flask/Django**: For creating a web-based interface (if applicable).
- **NumPy & Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this framework, ensure you have:
- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Required libraries can be installed via pip.




## How It Works
The framework operates by analyzing physiological signals such as heart rate variability, facial expressions, and voice tone. By employing machine learning models trained on diverse datasets, it accurately identifies stress levels based on real-time inputs.

### Key Components:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather physiological data using sensors or cameras.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models on labeled datasets to recognize stress indicators.
4. **Real-Time Analysis**: Implement live monitoring of stress levels based on incoming data.

## Usage
To start using the Stress Detection Framework:
1. Run the main application script:
2. Follow the prompts in the user interface to begin monitoring stress levels.
